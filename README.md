# Project-Happy-Hour-1

While alcohol consumption is recognized worldwide, our group wanted to find if there were any correlations between how happy
    
a country is and the amount of alcohol consumed, type of alcohol consumed, level of income and possibly temperature.  
    
In the Happiness and Alcohol Consumption dataset, 112 countries participated in a survey, where they were asked to provide a rating 

of how happy they were based on a scale from 0 to 10 with 10 being the happiest.


We quickly identified the top five happiest countries and the bottom 5 least happiest countries as:

TOP 5: Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, and Finland with the scores ranging from 7.5 to 7.4, respectively. 

There scores were so close, we can conclude they were equally happy. 

BOTTOM 5:  Madagascar, Tanzania, Liberia, Benin and Togo with the scores ranging from 3.63 to 3.3, respectivly.

Again, the scores were so close we can conclude the were equally least happy compared to each other. 

Within the top 5 countries:  While beer was the most consumed alcohol as a group, wine was the highest consumed alcohol with top two

happiest countries, Denmark and Switzerland.

Within the bottom 5 countries:  Beer again was the most consumed alcohol as a group, as well as the alcohol of choice for the bottom 2 countries, 

Tonga and Benin.  The overall volume of alcohol consumed per Capita was also much lower than the top 5, although Liberia was an outlier with above 140 liters per 

Capita of Spirits. 

With regards to income, we discovered there is a high correlation between GDP per Capita and Happiness Score with a correlation of .72.  In other words, 

wealthier countries were happier and drinking more alcohol.  But was there a correlation between the types of alcohol and their income level?

We found that to answer to be no.  While wine, had the highest correlation of .58 with GDP per Capita, it's moderate in scale with the beer following at .37

and spirits at .05.
    
We added a heat map to see if the happier countries temperatures were warmer or colder than those least happy.  We can see that the happier countries were in colder 

climates than those that were at the bottom of the scale.  

Our final analysis, is that income is the predominant factor in determining how happy the country was.  The wealthier countries also had higher disposable income to 

spend on alcohol leading to higher consumption per capita than those countries less happy.

The next step could be to pull data on number of bars within these countries to see if alcohol consumption is driven by social factors and whether the number of these 

type establishments are highly correlated.
