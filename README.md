# Project-Happy-Hour-1


    While alcohol consumption is recognized worldwide, our group wanted to find the correlation 

of alcohol consumption in comparison to happiness.  Based on 112 countries that participated 

in a survey we were able to find the top five happiest countries and the bottom 5 

least happiest countries from a happiness scale that asked participants to provide a rating. 

The happiness score is based on a scale from 0 to 10 with 10 being the happiest. In our 

analysis our team was able to discover that Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and 

Finland was in the top 5 happiest countries. With the scores ranging from 7.5 to 7.4, there 

were close approximations of scores that showed us  how close in ranking each country was 

towards each other. 

	Simultaneously, we discovered that the bottom 5 least happiest countries were 

Madagascar, Tanzania, Liberia, Benin and Togo. The scores from these countries were also 

close in range from each other ranging from 3.6 to 3.3. Some similarities between the top and 

bottom 5 showed that the top 5 countries are all within a high income level based on an 

income group while the bottom 5 were within the low income level. 

    Once we discovered which countries were within the top and bottom 5 categories we 

wanted to know which type of alcohol was consumed the most and least, given the types to 

be beer, wine and spirit. The data showed that Finland had the highest consumption for beer 

followed by spirit and Switzerland has the highest rate for wine.  As for the bottom 5, Tanzania 

and Togo was equivalent with the highest consumption rate of beer. Liberia consumed the 

most spirits while Togo took the lead in wine. Since Finland took the lead in beer and spirit, 

beer was the least popular choice in Norway while Iceland consumed the least amount of 

spirits and wine. As for the bottom 5, Liberia considered beer to be an unpopular choice. The 

least amount of spirits consumed was by Togo and wine being disliked by Tanzania. On 

average the alcohol that was most consumed throughout the entire data showed that beer 

was the most popular type with spirit and wine to follow. Western Europe and Central/Eastern 

Europe landed the highest Happiness score out of all other regions / Central and Eastern 

Europe has the highest consumption level.

    While the majority of the countries that participated in the survey have scores ranging 
 
 from 3 to 6, we can see a positive correlation between the comparison while the correlation 
 
 came out to be 0.72. Besides this comparison, we also wanted to know if there was a relationship 
 
 between the gdp and participants' choice of alcohol. Our study found that spirits had a low correlation 
 
 with a score of 0.05 followed by beer with 0.37 and wine with 0.58. While beer appeared to be the most 
 
 popular among the categories, wine persisted with a positive and highest correlation between the three.
